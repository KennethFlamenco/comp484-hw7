            <p>As part of the team of Sundered Realms, I was tasked with creating the GUI and mechanics of the games
                skill tree.
                Through this skil tree you would be able to buy skills that help upgrade your combat and movement in
                game for advantages against the enemies.
                I was also tasked with not just creating the skills for the players but creating the skill tree and
                logic needed to buy these skills.

            <p>Currently studying Computer Science at CSUN. I want to be able to apply all these new skills into game
                development.
                For my senior design project I along with 4 other teammates made a Roblox game called Sundered Realms.
                My experience
                with sundered realms lead me to dive deep more into game development and is something I would want to
                continue after college.
